Undertaking a project that involves multiple programming languages like C++, Python, and C provided me various learning opportunities and benefits.
Working on a project that utilizes different programming languages allows you to enhance your proficiency in each language. 
I gained hands-on experience in writing code, debugging, and understanding language-specific features and syntax.
Working with different languages encouraged me flexibility and adaptability in my coding approach. 
I learnt to adapt my coding style and techniques based on the requirements and constraints of each language
.C++, Python, and C represent different programming paradigms (e.g., object-oriented, procedural). 
By working with these languages, I gained insight into the strengths and weaknesses of each paradigm and learnt when to apply them effectively.Each language comes with its own set of tools, libraries, and frameworks.

**CONCEPTS**:-


Utilizing these resources in my project exposes me to a broader range of development tools and libraries, expanding my toolkit as a developer.Strong dose includes a code with numbers which involves essential skill to understand the problem statement thoroughly. In this case, the goal is to find four consecutive integers, each having exactly four distinct prime factors.Once the problem is understood, the next step is to design an algorithm to solve it.

Learning Linux commands can be a transformative experience, as it opens up a new world of managing files and directories through the command line. 
Starting with 'mkdir', one learns to create directories, setting the foundation for organizing files. 
The 'ls' command comes next, allowing one to list the contents of directories, providing insights into file management. 
With 'touch', users discover how to create new, empty files quickly, which is essential for scripting and programming tasks. 
Navigating through directories using 'cd' becomes second nature, enhancing one's ability to move efficiently within the filesystem. 
The 'rmdir' command teaches the importance of clean-up, as it removes empty directories, reinforcing good file management practices.
Editing files with 'gedit' introduces a user-friendly text editor, easing the transition from graphical interfaces to command-line operations. 
Lastly, 'gcc' unveils the power of compiling programs from source, a crucial skill for any aspiring programmer. 
Each command not only builds technical proficiency but also cultivates a mindset of exploration and problem-solving that is invaluable in the tech industry.




**STRONG DOSE**:-

**The provided code uses a straightforward approach**:
It defines a function (countDistinctPrimeFactors) to count the distinct prime factors of a given number.
It iterates over consecutive integers, checking if each integer satisfies the condition of having four distinct prime factors.
If four consecutive integers with four distinct prime factors each are found, the program prints them.With the algorithm designed, the next step is to translate it into code. 
This involves writing the necessary functions, loops, and conditional statements to execute the algorithm.Writing code typically involves iterative cycles of testing and debugging. 
After writing the initial implementation, it's essential to test it with various inputs to ensure it behaves as expected.
If any issues or bugs are encountered, they need to be identified and fixed through debugging
.Once the code is functional, it can be refined and optimized for performance, readability, and maintainability. 
This may involve restructuring the code, improving variable names, or optimizing algorithms for efficiency.
Writing clear and concise documentation and adding comments to the code are crucial for understanding its purpose and functionality, both for yourself and for others who may read or modify the code in the future.

Reflection can help improve coding skills and inform future coding endeavors.



**MEDIUM DOSE** :-
-----------------


The first learning experience involves defining a custom data type (club) using the struct keyword.
This helps understand how to encapsulate related pieces of data into a single entity, which is fundamental in object-oriented programming.
Writing the printFunction function involves understanding function syntax, parameter passing, and function invocation.
Learning how to define and use functions helps in organizing code and promoting code reusability.
Introducing a lambda function (printstatement) provides insight into the concept of anonymous functions and how they can be used to create short, inline functions for specific tasks.
It also demonstrates capturing variables from the enclosing scope.
The use of the auto keyword in variable declaration (auto variable = club{"...", 1079};) allows for automatic type inference, which simplifies code and improves readability.
It's important to understand when and how to use auto effectively.
Learning how to concatenate strings using the + operator (to_string(mem.roll_no) + mem.name) and output them to the console (cout << ... << endl;) is fundamental for displaying information to users.
Overall, writing the provided code involves a combination of understanding data types, functions, lambda functions, variable declaration, string manipulation, and outputting data.
It provides valuable hands-on experience in C++ programming concepts and practices.
